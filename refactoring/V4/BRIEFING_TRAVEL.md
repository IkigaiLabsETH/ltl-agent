## (Original Briefing Continues Below)

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Build perfect day booking detection in ONE DAY using Cursor, leveraging ElizaOS architecture and existing travel services.

**Core Value**: Agent identifies when rates are 10%+ below average at our 10 curated 5-star hotels.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strong Foundation (Leverage This)
- **TravelDataService**: Already has hotel metadata, seasonal patterns, simulated rates
- **Booking Optimization Actions**: Advanced algorithms exist
- **Hotel Database**: 10 curated luxury hotels ready
- **ElizaOS Framework**: Actions, Services, Providers architecture in place

### üéØ One-Day MVP Scope
**Focus**: Add real rate data + perfect day detection to existing services

## Implementation Strategy: Cursor Prompts

### Phase 1: Rate Data Service Enhancement (2 hours)

**Cursor Prompt 1:**
```
You are working on a TypeScript project using ElizaOS framework. 

Current file: src/services/TravelDataService.ts
- Has 10 curated luxury hotels with simulated rates
- Needs real rate data from Google Hotels scraping
- Must maintain existing interface compatibility

Task: Create a GoogleHotelsScraper class and enhance fetchCurrentHotelRates() to use Google Hotels data.

Requirements:
1. Keep existing HotelRateData interface
2. Create GoogleHotelsScraper class with Puppeteer-based scraping
3. Extract price charts and historical trends from Google Hotels
4. Maintain error handling and fallback to simulated data
5. Update every 4 hours (existing cache duration)
6. Focus on 10 hotels with their Google Hotels URLs

The scraper should extract price charts for each of our 10 curated hotels showing current vs historical pricing to identify below-average rates.

Focus on the specific hotel URLs from our curated database rather than general city pages.
```

**Cursor Prompt 2:**
```
Create GoogleHotelsScraper class for extracting price data.

Create new file: src/services/GoogleHotelsScraper.ts

Requirements:
1. Use Puppeteer for headless browser scraping
2. Extract price charts from specific hotel Google Hotels pages
3. Parse historical pricing trends for each hotel
4. Identify below-average rate periods
5. Handle rate limiting with intelligent delays

Key methods to implement:
- scrapePriceChart(hotel: CuratedHotel): Promise<PriceData>
- extractHistoricalTrends(page: Page): Promise<TrendData>
- detectBelowAverageRates(priceData: PriceData[]): Promise<RateOpportunity[]>

Use the existing curatedHotels array from TravelDataService to get specific hotel information and URLs.
```

**Cursor Prompt 3:**
```
Extend TravelDataService to add perfect day detection.

Add new method: detectPerfectDays(): PerfectDayOpportunity[]

Interface to add:
interface PerfectDayOpportunity {
  hotelId: string;
  hotelName: string;
  perfectDate: string;
  currentRate: number;
  averageRate: number;
  savingsPercentage: number;
  confidenceScore: number;
  reasons: string[];
  urgency: "high" | "medium" | "low";
}

Algorithm:
1. Use GoogleHotelsScraper to get price data
2. Calculate average rate for each hotel (last 30 days)
3. Find dates with rates 10%+ below average
4. Calculate confidence score based on data quality
5. Sort by savings percentage
6. Return top 5 opportunities

Integrate this into the existing getTravelData() method.
```

### Phase 2: Action Enhancement (2 hours)

**Cursor Prompt 4:**
```
Enhance bookingOptimizationAction.ts to include perfect day detection.

Current file has:
- performBookingOptimization() function
- HotelComparison interface
- Optimization criteria parsing

Add to the optimization:
1. Call travelService.detectPerfectDays()
2. Include perfect days in response
3. Prioritize perfect days in recommendations
4. Add urgency indicators

Update generateOptimizationResponse() to highlight perfect days:
"PERFECT DAY: Hotel X on Date Y - ‚Ç¨Z/night (X% below average)"

Keep existing Bitcoin philosophy and response format.
```

**Cursor Prompt 5:**
```
Enhance hotelDealAlertAction.ts to focus on perfect days.

Current file has:
- findCurrentDeals() function
- DealAlert interface
- Alert parameter parsing

Modify to:
1. Prioritize perfect day opportunities (10%+ savings)
2. Add "PERFECT DAY ALERT" prefix for high-value deals
3. Include confidence scores in alerts
4. Sort by savings percentage first

Update formatDealsResponse() to highlight perfect days prominently.
```

### Phase 3: Provider Enhancement (1 hour)

**Cursor Prompt 6:**
```
Enhance travelProvider.ts to include perfect day opportunities.

Current provider gives:
- Current deals
- Seasonal recommendations
- Travel context

Add to the context:
1. Perfect day opportunities (top 3)
2. Savings percentages
3. Urgency indicators
4. Booking recommendations

Update buildTravelContext() to include:
"üéØ PERFECT DAYS: Hotel X (Date Y) - ‚Ç¨Z/night (X% savings)"
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1 hour)

**Cursor Prompt 7:**
```
Test the perfect day detection system.

Create test scenarios:
1. Query: "Show me perfect booking days"
2. Query: "What are the best hotel deals right now?"
3. Query: "Find luxury hotels with big savings"

Expected responses should include:
- Perfect day opportunities
- Savings percentages
- Urgency indicators
- Booking recommendations

Verify all actions work together and provide consistent perfect day information.
```

## Target Hotels

### Our 10 Curated Luxury Hotels
The system will focus on these specific hotels from our existing database:

**Biarritz (4 hotels):**
- H√¥tel du Palais (biarritz_palace)
- H√¥tel Villa Eug√©nie (biarritz_regina) 
- Sofitel Biarritz Le Miramar (biarritz_sofitel)
- Beaumanoir Small Luxury Hotels (biarritz_beaumanoir)

**Bordeaux (3 hotels):**
- InterContinental Bordeaux (bordeaux_intercontinental)
- Burdigala Hotel (bordeaux_burdigala)
- La Grand'Maison Hotel & Restaurant (bordeaux_la_grand_maison)

**Monaco (3 hotels):**
- Hotel Hermitage Monte-Carlo (monaco_hermitage)
- Hotel Metropole Monte-Carlo (monaco_metropole)

### Google Hotels Scraping Strategy
- Use existing `curatedHotels` array from TravelDataService
- Extract specific hotel URLs from the database
- Scrape individual hotel pages for price charts
- Focus on visual trend analysis for each property

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Add to existing)
```sql
-- Add to existing database
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS perfect_day_opportunities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  hotel_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  perfect_date DATE NOT NULL,
  current_rate DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  average_rate DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  savings_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  confidence_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  reasons TEXT[],
  urgency VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(hotel_id, perfect_date)
);
```

### Key Interfaces to Add
```typescript
// Add to TravelDataService.ts
interface PerfectDayOpportunity {
  hotelId: string;
  hotelName: string;
  perfectDate: string;
  currentRate: number;
  averageRate: number;
  savingsPercentage: number;
  confidenceScore: number;
  reasons: string[];
  urgency: "high" | "medium" | "low";
}

// Add to existing actions
interface EnhancedOptimizationResult {
  perfectDays: PerfectDayOpportunity[];
  // ... existing fields
}
```
