## Recent Technical Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed service method typing in DailyCulinaryService by casting getService results to their specific service classes, enabling correct method access and TypeScript safety.
- Refactored travelKnowledgeProvider to comply with the Provider interface: removed unsupported properties (like 'priority'), ensured only 'name', 'description', and 'get' are exported, and moved helper methods outside the provider object.
- Corrected MarketKnowledge array handling: ensured all property accesses and function returns use the correct array structure, preventing runtime and type errors.
- Removed all 'private' modifiers from provider object methods, as these are not valid in object literals.
- Renamed the main async method in travelKnowledgeProvider from 'getContent' to 'get' to match the Provider interface.
- Fixed all linter and TypeScript errors related to object literal properties, method signatures, and array/object mismatches in the affected files.
- The codebase now passes type checks and linter validation for these modules, supporting robust extensibility for future culinary and travel intelligence features.
