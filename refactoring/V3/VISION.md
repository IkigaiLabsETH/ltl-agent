## Unified Mission Statement

**"Empowering high-performance living through AI-driven intelligence for luxury travel, dining, and daily wellness."**

- **Daily Health & Wellness Tips:** Achieve sustainable well-being with actionable daily guidance for training, home cooking, and mindfulness, seamlessly integrated into daily routines.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Modular Domain Engines:** Each domain (Hotel, Restaurant, Health) is implemented as a dedicated module with its own data sources, intelligence algorithms, and reporting logic.
