# Hotel Rate Intelligence MVP: Luxury Travel Optimization

## Executive Summary

**Hotel Rate Intelligence** is a specialized AI system that monitors 10 curated luxury hotels across Biarritz, Bordeaux, and Monaco to detect below-average rates using Google Hotels price charts. This delivers the "alpha" our friends wish they had - knowing exactly when to book luxury accommodations at optimal rates.

## Mission Statement

**"Luxury Travel Alpha: Automating the discovery of below-average rates at the world's finest hotels."**

## Technical Implementation

### Google Hotels Scraping Engine

```typescript
class GoogleHotelsScraper {
  async scrapePriceChart(hotelUrl: string): Promise<PriceData> {
    // Puppeteer-based visual chart extraction
    // Parses bar charts and trend lines
    // Extracts current vs historical pricing
    // Returns structured price data
  }
  
  async detectBelowAverageRates(priceData: PriceData): Promise<RateOpportunity[]> {
    // Analyzes visual price trends
    // Calculates 10% below average threshold
    // Generates confidence scores
    // Returns actionable opportunities
  }
}
```

### Rate Opportunity Detection Algorithm

```typescript
interface RateOpportunity {
  hotelId: string;
  hotelName: string;
  currentRate: number;
  averageRate: number;
  savingsPercentage: number;
  confidenceScore: number;
  dealDate: Date;
  googleHotelsUrl: string;
  bookingUrl: string;
}

class RateOpportunityDetector {
  private readonly BELOW_AVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.10; // 10%
  
  detectOpportunities(priceData: PriceData[]): RateOpportunity[] {
    return priceData
      .filter(data => this.isBelowAverage(data))
      .map(data => this.createOpportunity(data))
      .sort((a, b) => b.savingsPercentage - a.savingsPercentage);
  }
}
```
