# üö® Git History Rewrite Notice

## Important: Repository History Has Been Rewritten

**Date**: December 2024  
**Reason**: Security - Removed exposed API keys from git history  
**Impact**: All collaborators need to reset their local repositories  

## What Happened

During our code review refactoring work, we discovered that sensitive API keys were accidentally committed to the repository. To protect security, we used `git filter-repo` to completely remove these keys from the entire git history.

## What This Means for You

### üîÑ **Required Action for All Collaborators**

If you have a local copy of this repository, you **MUST** reset it to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Option 1: Fresh Clone (Recommended)
rm -rf ltl-agent
git clone https://github.com/IkigaiLabsETH/ltl-agent.git
cd ltl-agent

# Option 2: Reset Existing Repository
cd ltl-agent
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git clean -fd
```

### üö´ **What NOT to Do**

- ‚ùå Don't try to merge your local changes
- ‚ùå Don't pull without resetting first
- ‚ùå Don't push any local commits without coordination

## Current Branch Status

- **`main`**: Clean, no sensitive data
- **`code-review`**: Contains our refactoring work (Phase 1 & 2 complete)
- **All other branches**: Need to be recreated from the new history

## Our Refactoring Progress

### ‚úÖ **Completed Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Service Consolidation - Reduced 47 services to modular components
2. **Phase 2**: Code Modularization - Split 1495-line plugin.ts into 6 focused modules

### üîÑ **Next Phase**
3. **Phase 3**: Performance Optimization - Lazy loading and cold start improvements

## Security Improvements Made

1. **Added `.gitignore`** to prevent future accidental commits of sensitive files
2. **Removed all API keys** from git history
3. **Established security practices** for future development

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems after resetting your repository:
1. Check this notice first
2. Contact the development team
3. Create an issue if needed

**Note**: This history rewrite was necessary for security and will not affect the functionality of our code. All our refactoring work is preserved and ready for Phase 3.
