ðŸ“Š **BITCOIN MARKET ANALYSIS**

**Current Status:**
Bitcoin is currently trading at $${priceData.price.toLocaleString()} with a market cap of $${(priceData.marketCap / 1e12).toFixed(2)}T. 24h change: ${priceData.priceChange24h.toFixed(2)}%. Current supply: ${(priceData.circulatingSupply / 1e6).toFixed(2)}M BTC out of 21M max supply.

**Thesis Progress:**
${thesisData.progressPercentage.toFixed(1)}% progress toward $1M target. Estimated ${thesisData.estimatedHolders.toLocaleString()} addresses with 10+ BTC (${thesisData.holdersProgress.toFixed(1)}% of 100K target). Need ${thesisData.multiplierNeeded.toFixed(1)}x appreciation requiring ${thesisData.requiredCAGR.tenYear.toFixed(1)}% CAGR over 10 years.

**Key Catalysts Monitoring:**
â€¢ Sovereign Adoption: U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve discussions ongoing
â€¢ Institutional Infrastructure: Major banks launching Bitcoin services
â€¢ Regulatory Clarity: EU MiCA framework enabling institutional adoption
â€¢ Market Dynamics: Institutional demand absorbing whale selling pressure

**Risk Factors:**
â€¢ Macroeconomic headwinds affecting risk assets
â€¢ Regulatory uncertainty in key markets
â€¢ Potential volatility during major appreciation phases

**Investment Implications:**
The 100K BTC Holders thesis remains on track with institutional adoption accelerating. Path to $1M BTC depends on continued sovereign and corporate adoption scaling faster than the 21M supply constraint.
